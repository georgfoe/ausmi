# A.U.S.M.I. - Apenas Um Sistema Muito Inteligente ...but without google (and OpenAI)

I forked this repo to try, whether it ist possible to use CoquiTTS (https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) for text2speech-part. Unfortunatly I cannot test this version at the moment, as I have no OpenAI-API-Account.

Maybe it could also be possible to use some kind of Gpt4All-Model for the LLM-part in the future.
